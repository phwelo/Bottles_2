# Bottles_2
Second Revision Bottles Tool

#### This is a tool that I've been developing since my daughters were born with a somewhat rare disease called PKU -- http://www.pkunews.org/about/intro.htm
#### The project gives us the ability to log the girls' phe intake quickly while logging the details to a centralized location.  Coupled with tcpdf for generating reports and outputting pdf, we are able to easily get records to their dieticians to assure that their levels are always within acceptable range.
#### Implemented in PHP and Javascript, utilizing jquery https://jquery.com/ Semantic and http://semantic-ui.com/
